            "1. **Check the length of the list**: Make sure the list you're trying to access has at least as many elements as you're trying to access. You can do this by printing out the length of the list before the line that's causing the error.\n",

            "\n",
            "2. **Check the index**: Double-check that the index you're using is within the valid range. In Python, indices start at 0, so if your list has 5 elements, the valid indices are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",

            "   ```python\n",

            "\n",
